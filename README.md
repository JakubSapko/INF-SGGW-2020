## General info

This repository holds my codes from a course of programming in C# on a platform RunCode. Because this is an entry-level course on 1st grade it doesn't cover anything more ambitious than standard learning exercises for newbies. This repository is more of a storage than an actual project.

## Topics

* LAB01
  * returning values through functions
* LAB02
